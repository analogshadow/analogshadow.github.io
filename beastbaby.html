     <p>Here are some pictures of the early stages of our
        cluster experiment testbed, dubbed <i>BeastBaby</i>.
        Although it is very difficult to photograph, these pictures do 
        illustrate the basic idea. Eight slog A AthlonII motherboards are
        mounted vertically inside a 24" deep rack cabinet. This obviously 
        took way more time to setup than just simply finding 8 cases, but
        this conserves shelf and floor space in the lab which makes it
        worth it. The plan from this point includes covering the front 
        and back with removable plexiglass, placing exit heat fans on the 
        top, and running a 4" flexible air duct directly from the lab's
        air handler down to the bottom of the cabinet. This should turn
        out to be a much more efficient for cooling than using individual 
        cases. 
     </p>
     <p>Of course far more computing power can already be found in servers
        costing just a few thousand dollars, but the idea here is not to 
        build a production compute cluster. 
        The goal is to facilitate experiments with cluster aware servers,
        file systems, programing libraries and techniques, as well as conduct
        various elaborate networking exercises.
