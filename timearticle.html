  <h2>Scope of Discussion</h2>
  <p>The time keeping features of modern computers is something often taken for granted until 
     one actually has to create some software that utilizes them. The good news is that this area
     has been around for a while and therefor some outstanding solutions exist for most situations. 
     The bad news is that computer time is still widely misunderstood and often the cause of major,
     yet avoidable problems.      
     For the sake of giving me a good resource to point people to who could use a good run down
     on this area, I have written this article. So if you ever need to work on a program that in
     any way uses clocks, calendars, and computers read on and you might catch something you never thought
     about before. 
  </p>


  <h3>The Basic Problem</h3>
  <p>The basic problem is that our calendar system is actually very complicated. Days of the week, months, 
     leap years, time zones, and other details can quickly add up to a huge mess. Let us say we need
     to know the date and time 5 minutes from now. Simple right? Start making a program to do that,
     for that matter <i>do it properly</i>, and your head will explode. Now throw in a situation were
     multiple users need to utilize the program from different places in the world all simultaneously
     connected through the internet in different time locals. Starting to see the challenge? Remember Y2K?
  </p>
  <p>This is of course not even to mention even more demanding tasks such as translating times to 
     something other than the Gregorian calendar (the calendar system most commonly recognized in
     the west as "normal"). Perhaps you have clients in Israel, China, Iran, India, or even Russia, 
     that would like to do something with a different calendar. Though this may not seem like something
     you would ever need to worry about there are much more common tasks that are deceptively simple.
  </p>
  <p>Think of a real time data logger that needs to save a value every single hour. How should it behave
     during the switch in and out of daylight saving time? How should a PVR behave in the same situation?
  <p>
  <p>By and large, one does not really need to do that much to solve these kinds of problems as long as 
     he or she has some understand of what is going on. 
     Too often programmers' and administrators' sentiment is that of "let the OS worry about it", or
     "just use the library functions without thinking". This is really the wrong attitude seeing as
     how so many things can go wrong.
  </p>


  <h3>The Basic Solution</h3>
  <p>The root of the solution to simplifying computational time keeping is very simple. 
     <i>Separate the task of tracking the passage of time, from that of calendar operations.</i>
     To put it another way, the science of atomic clocks is another field of study from astronomy.
     The majority of hardware and software around today at some level tracks time in terms of
     <i><b>the number of seconds past 1970 UTC</b></i>. 
     This way programs can simply think of the time and date as a simple
     integer. Every second has a unique and unambiguous number. Saving the time something happened 
     requires just one number. Moving forward or backward in time requires simple arithmetic. Time
     before midnight December 31 1970 UTC is expressed as a negative number. When
     a date and time needs to be presented to a human, this integer gets <i>rendered</i> into what 
     ever calender system, time zone, and format is needed. The reverse takes place when the time
     is input from a human. 
     This is often referred to as <i>Unix time</i>, or even <i>ANSI C time</i>.
  </p>
  <p>So to answer the above question, the data logger and PVR never even need to think about 
     daylight saving time except for displaying, and getting times from users.
     Typically this is all done with relatively standard C library functions. Higher level 
     languages of course wrap around these (if you are lucky enough to even get some exposed
     means to use them). The basic clock function is <b>time()</b>, and the basic calendar render / parser
     routines are <b>localtime()</b>, <b>gmtime()</b>, <b>strftime()</b>,
     and <b>mktime()</b> defined in <b>time.h</b>. See my portable time in C cheat sheet below.
     Check with your man pages or other documentation for further details, 
     and various other functions. Windows of course does not disappoint those expecting its
     usual silliness, by providing a dozen or so supplemental API functions to preform the
     exact same tasks with much more difficulty. Consult the Windows platform SDK for details. 
     It is also worth noting that any serious time aware application should not be run on any
     Win 9x/ME version.
  </p>

  <h2>Solutions have Problems</h2>

  <h3>32 bit Platforms</h3>
  <p>On most 32 bit platforms, a signed 32 bit integer is used for the time value. This
     gives an effective range of December 12, 1901 8:45:52 PM GMT through January 1,
     2038 3:14:07 AM GMT. The Y2K "crisis" has come and gone, but the 
     <a href="http://pw1.netcom.com/~rogermw/Y2038.html">Y2038</a> issue is quite real.
     Many systems already have solutions in place. 64 bit Unix systems use a 64 bit integer, and
     are unaffected. More likely to be an issue are file formats that use a 32 bit number. If you 
     are designing a system to be used for a while, or that holds historical records prior to 1902,
     you will need more than 32 bits. Some formats that intended to only hold dates in the present
     use unsigned 32 bit. This trades dates prior to 1970 for longer future use. A full 64 bits of
     file storage can be hard to justify in a binary file format. Often a 40 or 48 bits may be used,
     or even a 48 bits for seconds, and 16 bits for fractions of a second. Even still, it certainly
     beats 64 or more <u>bytes</u> for storing time as text. 
  </p>
  <p>Note that in addition to a host being 64 bit, the C runtime libraries must also support time
     beyond a 4 byte integer. A quick test on 64 bit Fedora Core 4 installation running on x86_64,
     yields no problems for years like 1712 and 2135.
     For years before 1900 I used a negative number in the <b>tm</b> structure.
     Be careful, because that same test on a 32 bit box generated a segmentation fault.
  </p>

  <h3>Daylight Saving Time</h3>
  <p>Daylight saving time is unequivocally one of the most profoundly idiotic ideas in the history
     of the human race. In only stands to reason that it of course causes problems with software. 
     DST can and is taken into account in calendar and locale functions on most platforms. The
     primary problem is that <b>at any time a government can, and will change the rules</b>
     for moving in and out of DST. What this means is that if a system really wants to use a DST
     scheme, it needs to have a way to be updated. For example, in 2005 the US decided to change
     to a new rule starting in 2007. What sort of chaos this creates with older systems with out
     of date locale definitions remains to be seen. 
     See also: <a href="http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/e.html">Daylight Saving Time History</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Leap Seconds</h3>
  <p>UTC, or universal coordinated time, throws in a serious complexity. 
     UTC adds some <i>leap seconds</i> into the mix at various points throughout its calendar.
     These leap seconds manifest themselves as the 61st second of the minute they occur.
     Further more UTC leap seconds, the rarer still double leap second, and the yet unused day with one less second,
     only happen when "they" say so. 
     So in the sense of the current time, a system must be connected to an outside time source to stay
     aware of those events. In the sense of historic time, a lookup table is needed. 
     This is really just another detail of our calendar system, and since the integer time programming
     style is to internally be calendar agnostic, this is not that big of an issue.
     More serious is that with UTC the very definition of a day, minute, and hour is different!
     Since it is very common for applications to use minutes, hours, and days, the most popular strategy
     is basically to ignore leap seconds. Here are some of the effects ignoring leap seconds in your applications,
     and caused by work arounds built into operating systems. 
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Be aware that when rendering a time into the "UTC calendar" the number 61 can be used for 
       the number of seconds past the minute.</li>
   <li>The modern unix linear integer time representation has some numbers that represent two 
       different seconds in the UTC calendar.
       It is also possible for a number to not represent any second in the UTC calendar.
       Check platform documentation for details of how to find out which numbers this applies to.
       The negative effect of using a number line that does not 100% reflect the number of elapsed
       seconds since its inception, is arguably more than offset by the benefits of not having 
       consider minutes that are not 60 seconds.</li>
   <li>The effects of these leap second events are rare enough to be comparable to the artifacts of clock 
       synchronization</li>
   <li>Time series data sets utilizing a single integer representation of time intervals should use the
       <b>first number in the interval</b> for the representation.  For example, 2:00 for the interval 2:00 - 3:00.</li>
   <li>Presumably, the occasionally available <b>difftime()</b> takes into account leap seconds.</li>
   <li>For more gory details check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">this wikipedia page</a>.</li>
   <li>Another way to look at the situation is to say, even though integer time style programming uses the
       integer to track the amount of time passed, it really does so only for the purpose of simplifying
       calendar operations. Therefor, if the overall goal is to make calendar operations easy to perform 
       for a computer program, it is acceptable for the unix time to differ a few seconds from the real number of seconds
       since 1970 if it makes the calendar correct. A computer would make a terrible choice for a machine to count
       the number of real elapsed seconds over a long period of time anyway. </li>
   <li>When asked "What is time?", Einstein is reported to have said, "time is what the clock on the wall says." </li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Common Implementation Challenges</h2>
  <p>As great as integer time style programming is, this snazzy approach still hasn't made its way everywhere yet.
     Other times it can still be unclear how to proceed.
     There are also plenty of puzzles given to us by our friends in Redmond to solve.
     Let's review a few I have encountered in recent years.
  </p>

  <h3>.Net</h3>
  <p>The .Net runtime internally holds time as the number of milliseconds since 1900 UTC.
     One would think converting between Unix and .Net time would be a matter of moving between seconds and
     milliseconds and then applying a 70 year offset. Not so fast, because at least with C#, dotneters don't use this integer
     for what I'm calling ".Net time". Instead they use <i>objects</i> in the form of the <b>DateTime</b>, and
     <b>TimeSpan</b> data types. What is needed is a means to convert from a Unix time_t integer to a .Net DateTime
     object and back. Here is my example of how to get the job done.
  </p>

<table><caption>Over the river and through the woods, from .Net to Unix time we go...</caption><tr><td bgcolor="wheat"><pre>

 /* convert a unix time_t into a DateTime object in local time */
 public static DateTime time_convert_local(int unix_time)
 {
  DateTime unix_utc, epoch_offset = new System.DateTime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);

  unix_utc = epoch_offset.AddSeconds( (double) unix_time);
  return unix_utc.ToLocalTime();
 }

 /* convert a unix time_t into a DateTime object in univeral time */
 public static DateTime time_convert_utc(int unix_time)
 {
  DateTime unix_utc, epoch_offset = new System.DateTime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);

  unix_utc = epoch_offset.AddSeconds( (double) unix_time);
  return unix_utc;
 }

 /* convert a DateTime object in local time to a unix time_t */
 public static int DateTime_convert_local(DateTime dotnet_time)
 {
  DateTime epoch_offset = new System.DateTime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);
  TimeSpan ts = dotnet_time.ToUniversalTime().Subtract(epoch_offset);
  return (int) ts.TotalSeconds;
 }

</pre></td></tr></table>

  <h3>MS SQL server</h3>
  <p>If you ever encounter a MS SQL server, note that it does have a native data type for time called DateTime.
     Unfortunately it is in no way time zone aware. Thus, if you wanted to store time correctly in a
     MS SQL server, there are two options. The first is of course to store it as an integer in Unix time. 
     The second would be to use the DateTime data type, but store all the times in UTC. The challenge arises
     when an existing database uses DateTime in a local time zone that uses daylight saving time. This situation
     actually arises in many software applications that do not use integer time style programming. 
  </p>
  <p>For starters there will be one hour a year that <i>can not</i> be used at all - the hour before the switch from daylight
     to standard time. There will also be one hour each year that <i>is not</i> used at all - the hour skipped over during
     the switch to DST. There is nothing can be done about this. Going from Unix time to the local time is a routine
     operation. Going from the DateTime fields in the database's locale time to Unix time will also work, provided
     <b>mktime()</b> is using a locale definition that can figure out witch times during the year are in DST, and ST.
     The trick is to set the <b>tm_isdst</b> member of the <b>tm structure</b> to -1. 
     See <u>Converting an arbitrary date in the local time locale to Unix time</u> below.
  </p>

  <h3>Web Applications</h3>
  <p>It would certainly be useful if there was a good way to find out the local time zone
     that a web client is connecting from. This way a page could render its time zones
     correctly for each visitor. There is a way in javascript to return the time zone offset
     in minutes. To some extent, this could be resolved to a timezone in a lookup table.
     I recommend two very important design points for web applications: 
     <b>always specify the time zone when displaying a time</b>, and <b>give the
     user a way to change the output to a different time zone</b>. For example,
     if a corporate intranet application is to be used by personal in three time zones,
     a drop down box could allow for the selection of any one of those three plus UTC.
     A conference call at 3:00 PM could be anything, but one at 3:00 PM CST is at 
     least a real time even you are in MST. A drop down box allowing you to render
     the time as 2:00 PM MST is even better. Also don't forget to use the daylight
     saving time version of the time zone name. Because many places do not observe
     DST, people may mentally convert a time wrong even when they are aware of the
     differences in zones.
