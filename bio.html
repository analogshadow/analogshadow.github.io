              <p>Since joining Google in May of 2016, I have resided in Seattle, Washington with my wife and our children.
                 Prior to that, in August of 2013 we moved to Houston, Texas were I worked for Alert Logic.
                 Previous still, I worked for Doozer Software in the service of Southern Company in    Birmingham, Alabama.
                 Birmingham is also where my professional ventures started with a consultancy partnership.     
              </p>
              <p>
                 You may find me in various corners of the free and open source software world, or
                 at a conference.
